### Fixed



## [V0.8.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- **Principal Variation Search (PVS)**: Transitioned core minimax search to PVS to utilize aggressive zero-window searches `(alpha, alpha + 1)` and `(beta - 1, beta)` on subsequent moves, drastically cutting down the search space.
- **Late Move Reductions (LMR)**: Enabled 1-ply depth reductions for deep quiet moves (`turn_counter > 3`, `depth >= 3`) that are not captures, promotions, or checks.
- **Configuration System Expansion**: Added dynamic toggles `enable_pvs` and `enable_lmr` in `src/config.rs`.
- **Comprehensive Unit Testing**: Added `search_feature_toggles_test` in `src/search_service.rs` to programmatically verify functional correctness and node-pruning.
- **LCT II Benchmark Achievement**: Achieved **2110 ELO** (+60 Elo increase) by solving new positional and endgame positions (such as `LCTII.POS.13` and `LCTII.END.01`).
- **NPS & Depth Benchmarks**: Achieved a monumental **19x search speedup** at depth 9 by reducing evaluated nodes from 25.9M to 1.2M (95% search space reduction).

### Added

### Fixed



## [V0.7.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- O(1) Mailbox Board (`board.mailbox: [u8; 64]`) keeping a direct piece lookup cache on the Board struct, eliminating O(12) bitboard scan loops inside the hot recursive search paths.
- 128-bit Compact Zobrist Transposition Entries (16-Byte memory footprint) by bit-packing chess moves into a `u16` and depth into an `i8`, maximizing L1/L2 cacheline density (4 entries per cacheline).
- Flat array Transposition Table (`ZobristTable`) replacing `CHashMap` with depth-preferred replacement policy to eliminate CPU cache misses and lock congestion.
- Incremental Move Sorting (Selection Sort / Pick Best Move) in standard minimax search loops and quiescence search to completely bypass O(N log N) sorting overhead on early Beta cutoffs.
- Underpromotions configuration toggle (`use_underpromotions`, default `false` for search, `true` for tests) to skip suboptimal Rook and Bishop promotions during search for additional NPS gains.
- Dynamic transposition table capacity initialization via configuration.

### Fixed

## [V0.6.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Migrated engine to 100% Heap-Free search recursion using stack-allocated MoveList & MoveRawList
- Refactored move generation signatures to populate stack lists via mutable borrows
- Optimized double-check and check detection using direct popcnt count_ones on attackers bitboards
- Added robust capacity safety tests in model.rs with zero compiler warnings
- Enabled all FIDE-legal pawn promotions (Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight) in `validate_and_add_promotion_moves` to make the engine 100% rules-compliant
- Added fully recursive Perft (Performance Test) suite supporting `startpos` and `Kiwipete` benchmarks to mathematically guarantee move generation correctness

### Fixed

### Added
- Fix integer underflow in calculate_thinking_time and reduce Movetime buffer to 50ms
- Implement Obvious Moves early exit when only 1 legal root move exists
